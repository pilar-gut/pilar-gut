## Hi there 👋

**Cytometry in R**

- Location: Barcelona
- Favourite fluorophore: BV421
- Previous coding experience: kinda basic use of R packages like flowWorkspace, ggplot, ggcyto, flowCore, openCyto, etc
- What I hope to get from this course: to learn a different and more efficient way to analyse data
